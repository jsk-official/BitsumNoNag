# BitsumNoNag
For those who truly do hate it, this removes the Process Lasso nag/activation notification window.
I highly encourage anybody using this to purchase Process Lasso if they have the funds for it, if not, here you go!

Bitsum can request me to take this down by just opening an issue on this repository.
